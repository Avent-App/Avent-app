# Avent

Avent is an app designed to help interns find events that are relevant to their interests. The app allows users to search for events by keyword and location. Event listings include information about the event, such as the host, location, time, and description. Avent also allows users to RSVP for events and create their own events to share.

## Installation

Clone the repo to your local machine and run the following code:

Next, cd into the avent-app folder and run the frontend using this command.

```bash
npm start
```

For this next step, make sure that PostgresSQL is installed and running on your computer.
You will need to run the command below and press enter twice to create the database tables required for the backend to run.
